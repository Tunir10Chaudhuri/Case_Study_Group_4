Steps to use JAR file start-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:

1. Download JAR file from GitHub.

2. Paste it in this location:
C:\Users\{your username}\.m2\repository\io\spring\start\start-client\0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

3. Open the folder where start spring io is present and visit Target folder of Start Client, paste it there as well.

4. Open Spring Tools and visit current workspace, paste it again in Target of Start Client.

5. Update Maven project of only Start Client.

6. Open the folder where you cloned start.spring.io from GitHub. Then open command prompt on that location. Execute the following command:
